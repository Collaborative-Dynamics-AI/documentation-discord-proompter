# Godmode

> Theres a [staff-setting](../command/staff-settings####/staff-settings%20godmode) called "godmode". Every user and role that has godmode enabled, is allowed to do almost everything with Proompter. This setting should only be activated for the highest Admins of the server
> Pretty much the only thing godmode users/role cannot do, is managing prompts from other people, that includes inspecting them if they aren't posted
