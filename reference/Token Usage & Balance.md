## Token Usage & Balance

> Every use of Proompter Pro gets now added to your account. You can see your current balance and token usage with </balance:1128471089442476123>. At the beginning every user gets a balance of 5$ credited.
> There are two different ways of token usage. First, paid usage which gets credited against your balance. Second, free usage which doesn't get counted towards your balance
- Paid actions are:
  - Talking to Proompter Pro in the chats.
  - Using the manage/edit commands to regenerate prompt intros/portal descriptions/emojis
- Free actions are:
  - Creating a prompt intro message
  - Create a portal description & emoji
> The free actions right now are those which happen automatically. All of them run on GPT-3.5

*Note: At this point everything is just for testing. Balance cannot be bought and the model cannot be changed. You will not be charged for so called "Paid actions"*
