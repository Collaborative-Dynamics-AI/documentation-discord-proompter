# Balance Packages
> We offer three different packages:
- **$5 Balance**
- **$10 Balance**
- **$20 Balance**
> You can [buy](../slash-command/balance####/balance%20buy) any combination of packages in a single order


## Bonus Balance
> Depending on the size of your order, you get certain bonuses:
- If your order total is `>=$20`, you get a __**$2 bonus**__ for each `$20`
- If your order total, or remaining amount after crediting the `$20` bonuses, is `>=$10`, you get a __**$0.75 bonus**__

### Examples:
- `1x$20` Package: **$2 bonus**
- `2x$10` Packages: **$2 bonus**
- `2x$20 + 2x$5` Packages: **$4 + $0.75 bonus**
- `1x$5` Package: **$0 bonus**



**Note:**
> The above examples describe the amount of packages in a **single order**. Buying `2x$10` packages in **two separate orders** will add you `$1.50` of bonuses NOT `$2`
