# Tier Channel Setup

> In total you need 3 channels for the tiers:
> - **Forum Channel:** *Prompts will be posted in here*
> - **Text Channel:** *Prompt portal to have a list with all the available prompts*
> - **Text Channel:** *For prompt updates*

> The portal and update channel can be shared with other tiers, forum needs to be a seperate for each tier
> Technically it's also possible to have the same channel for the portal and the updates, but it's not recommended
