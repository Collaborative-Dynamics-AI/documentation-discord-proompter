# Chatbots

## How to talk to the chatbots?
> You can either mention a chatbot or reply to one of it's messages
> Editing the message by including the mention afterwards doesn't work. If you forgot to mention the bot, either send a message that only contains the mention, or delete and resend your message with the mention

## How to talk to the chatbots privately?
> Direct messages are not supported, due to how the chatbots work. You can create a private thread on this Discord Server to have conversations with all the different chatbots

- Go to any of the text-channels you can write in
- Click on the `#` at the top right next to the search bar

- Give it any title and enable `Only people you invite and moderators can see` to make it a private thread. Or leave it unticked to make it a public thread
