# Chatbots

## How to talk to the chatbots?
> You can either mention a chatbot or reply to one of it's messages
> Editing the message by including the mention afterwards doesn't work. If you forgot to mention the bot, either send a message that only contains the mention, or delete and resend your message with the mention

> On mobile the role suggestions don't work at all, and on Desktop it often happens that it will not show the desired roles when entering the `@` sign into the chat. In those cases you can copy & paste the raw [role IDs](../Good%20to%20Know/Get%20IDs%20of%20Roles-Users-Channels). Those are available in the <#1137217914802548796> post of each bot (`Role ID`) and also in the results of the [/find chatbot](../../slash-command/find####/find%20chatbot) command. They look like this: `<@&1234567890>`. Copy the whole thing and paste it into the chat, if done correctly, it will turn into the blue role mentioned

- Go to any of the text-channels you can write in
- Click on the `#` at the top right next to the search bar
