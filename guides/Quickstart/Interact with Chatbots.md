## How to talk to the chatbots privately?
> Direct messages are not supported, due to how the chatbots work. You can create a private thread on this Discord Server to have conversations with all the different chatbots
> - Go to any of the text-channels you can write in
> - Click on the `#` at the top right next to the search bar
> - `Create` and then enable `Only people you invite and moderators can see` to make it a private thread. Or leave it unticked to make it a public thread
> Then simply start chatting with any of the chatbots by mentioning them in your messages

## Context Management
> If you delete or edit a message, it will do so in the context too. You can get more details about the loaded context be using the [**/context**](https://discord.com/channels/1100933695986208849/1136860935991083079/1136860950587260990) command
